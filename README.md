**Amtech Mail Sender SDK Documentation**
======================================

**Overview**
---------
The Mail Sender *SDK* provides an easy way to send emails through an *API*, utilizing Node.js and browser environments. The SDK abstracts the complexity of sending emails and handles API calls to send email messages in both server-side (Node.js) and client-side (browser) applications. you need to send them through *HTTPS* or at least *HTTP* it means, run your frontend code with a live server in *VSCODE* to run it on browser.

Key Features:
- **Node.js & Browser Support**: Works in both environments.
- **API Integration**: Seamlessly connects to the mail sending API.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages.
- **Cross-Platform**: Automatically detects the environment and adapts the fetch API accordingly.
