Amtech Mail Sender SDK Documentation
======================================

Overview
---------
The Mail Sender SDK provides an easy way to send emails through an API, utilizing Node.js and browser environments. The SDK abstracts the complexity of sending emails and handles API calls to send email messages in both server-side (Node.js) and client-side (browser) applications.

Key Features:
- Node.js & Browser Support: Works in both environments.
- API Integration: Seamlessly connects to the mail sending API.
- Error Handling: Provides clear error messages.
- Cross-Platform: Automatically detects the environment and adapts the fetch API accordingly.

Installation
------------
1. Install the SDK:
2. 
sh:
   npm install mail-sender-sdk


2. Usage in Node.js:
js:
   import { sendEmail } from 'mail-sender-sdk';

   const apiKey = 'your-sendgrid-api-key';
   const from = 'sender@example.com';
   const to = 'recipient@example.com';
   const subject = 'Test Email';
   const body = 'This is a test email body.';
   const companyName = 'Your Company';

   sendEmail(from, to, companyName, subject, body, apiKey)
       .then(response => {
           console.log('Email sent successfully!', response);
       })
       .catch(error => {
           console.error('Error sending email:', error);
       });


3. Usage in the Browser:
   
html:
   <script type="module" src='index.js'></script>

   into the index.js file:
            import { sendEmail } from './path/to/index.js';

                const apiKey = 'your-sendgrid-api-key';
                const from = 'sender@example.com';
                const to = 'recipient@example.com';
                const subject = 'Test Email';
                const body = 'This is a test email body.';
                const companyName = 'Your Company';

                sendEmail(from, to, companyName, subject, body, apiKey)
                    .then(response => {
                        console.log('Email sent successfully!', response);
                    })
                    .catch(error => {
                        console.error('Error sending email:', error);
                    });
